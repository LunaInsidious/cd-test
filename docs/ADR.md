# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This document records architectural decisions made during the development of the CD tool.

## Format

Each decision record should follow this format:

```
## ADR-XXXX: [Title]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Status: [Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded]

### Context
[Description of the problem and constraints]

### Decision
[What was decided]

### Consequences
[Positive and negative consequences of the decision]

### Alternatives Considered
[Other options that were evaluated]
```

## Decision Records

### ADR-0001: Initial Dependencies Selection
Date: 2025-07-17
Status: Accepted

#### Context
The CD tool requires robust schema validation and development tooling for TypeScript development following TDD principles.

#### Decision
- **zod**: For runtime schema validation of configuration files
- **Biome**: For linting and formatting (unified tool)
- **Vitest**: For testing framework
- **TypeScript**: With strict configuration from @tsconfig/strictest

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Zod provides excellent TypeScript integration and runtime validation
- Biome offers unified linting/formatting with good performance
- Vitest provides modern testing with excellent TypeScript support
- Strict TypeScript configuration ensures code quality

**Negative:**
- Initial setup complexity
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with these tools

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Schema validation**: Joi, Yup (chose Zod for TypeScript integration)
- **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint + Prettier (chose Biome for unified approach)
- **Testing**: Jest (chose Vitest for modern ESM support and performance)
